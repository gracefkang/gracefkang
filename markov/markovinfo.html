  this is a javascript/html project using markov chain generation ! <br>
  i used an archive of various text sources as the input to mimic multiple writing styles
</p>
<p> the main constraint for the project was that the accuracy of the generator was dependent
   upon the length of the sample .txt file, and i couldn't use extremely large files due
   to loading times and such. thus, the generators are a bit nonsensical, but funny nonetheless.
   i used shakespeare, trump, kanye, and dril as sources because they are all twitter accounts
   that have a distinct writing style and tend not to make sense on their own, so the limitations
   of the markov generator wouldn't be as noticable/much of a problem.
